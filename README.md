# MIDI-beatbox
C++ arduino ino file. Transform arduino into a MIDI device.
Code that turns arduino board into a native MIDI device for the purposes of making music. Device has 16 buttons with 4 banks. Each bank holds 16 sounds so that gives you 64 programmable buttons. Also has 4 potentiometers for EQ, vocal adjustments, envelopes, automation, etc. 
I also laser cut the wooden frame that holds the components, soldered the buttons to the wires plugged in to the arduino, and created and etched the circuit that makes the beatbox work onto a PCB (printed circuit board). This turns it into a fully functional 64 programmable button MIDI beatbox that can be used with any DAW like Ableton, etc to make live or pre-recorded music!
Programs used: Arduino IDE, VSCode, Autodesk (Fusion360, EAGLE), and a PCB etching program.
